                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    1) <u>Best practices</u> - understanding the importance of writing code one step 
                    at a time and also testing your code throughout writing it to ensure functionality 
                    to achieve the end result. This has not only benefited me in the classroom setting, 
                    but also in my day to day as a SQL report developer. I have found that I am able to 
                    be more consistent with the code I write and am more knowledgeable about the purpose 
                    for each line of code. 
                    <br><br>

                    2) <u>Learnerâ€™s mindset</u> - taking CSIS 1550 was really the trigger for my drive to become 
                    a software developer. SQL was the first programming language I was introduced to; so 
                    learning SQL and then introducing Java into my curriculum, I was able to adapt concepts 
                    from each language to help build a strong foundation for programming. It has also sparked 
                    an eagerness to learn additional programming languages and has been a big motivator in 
                    adjusting my degree program to include web development.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    3) <u>Thinking outside the box</u> - being someone who thinks very literally, all my life I have 
                    felt it was a weakness or disadvantage. Learning SQL and Java has made me realize that it is, 
                    in fact, a strength and can help me look at concepts or problems in a more simpler way and 
                    avoid overthinking them. An example of this is noticing the similarity between while loops 
                    and recursion (while this is true, do this versus until this is true, do this). Utilizing my 
                    natural way of thinking as a strength has improved my communication skills in contributing 
                    to constructive conversation with peers and having more confidence to share innovative ideas.
